					<img class="intext-image" src="images/index.jpg" alt="Image of Dog">We are a close family being well-orientated breeders of this wonderful breed. We specialize in European type English Creme Golden Retriever puppies, bred from Champion dogs imported from Ukraine, Hungary, and other countries including linage in their pedigrees from all over the world. We have dedicated ourselves to produce outstanding quality golden retriever puppies with all the show looks for very nice quality family pets. Our goldens are loved and respected members of our family, each puppy bred is nurtured, cared for and loved. While they spend most of their time enjoying the pleasures of being our beloved pets we do take pride in our dogs and their offspring.
					</p>
					<p>
					Our breeding females are OFA hip, elbow, heart, and OFA eye certified as well as ICT tested too. Our puppies are the result of careful and selective breeding providing beautiful puppies bred for temperament, breed type, and most all to produce wonderful companions or family additions. While placing puppies into loving homes is first and foremost, however maintaining and achieving a quality of excellence is our goal.
					</p>
					<p>
					We first became familiar with the breed as pet owners, when we purchased our first Golden puppy that was to become a companion for our family in 1994. Little did we know at the time how our love for the breed would continue to grow into what has now become an intimate passion for us; with breeding only one litter of puppies from each of our girls just one time a year. It is our love for Goldens that we have with having chosen to raise them allowing families such as ours, the joy of owning and sharing the companionship they have to offer.
